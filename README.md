# AR-VR-Group-6 — Local Dev Branch

## Project Overview

### What is this?

This is our Group 6 project for London South Bank University. We built a virtual reality tour of the LSBU campus using A-Frame, so that prospective and current students can explore the university without having to be there in person. You can use it in a normal browser on your laptop or phone, or put on a VR headset for the full experience.

We filmed five real locations on campus and turned them into 360° videos with voiceovers, captions, and on-screen labels that pop up as you look around.

> **This is the `local-dev` branch.** All videos, audio and images are served directly from your PC — no Cloudflare R2 needed. Just run `app.py` and everything loads from your local `assets/` folder.

## What's inside the tour

- **Student Centre** — the first floor, the bar area (The Venue), and the cafeteria upstairs
- **Cafeteria** — the seating booths, the student kitchen, and links to the art block and Faraday wing
- **Outside Student Centre** — the view outside including Tesco opposite, LSBU Hub to the left, and Borough Road building
- **LSBU Hub** — the Student Help Desk, the coffee shop, the library, study rooms, and the sports hall
- **Library Courtyard** — the quiet outdoor space in the centre of the library
- **Robot Special Feature** — a bonus video of a robot roaming through the Student Centre entrance

## How to run it locally

```bash
python app.py
```

Open your browser and go to **https://localhost:5000**

You'll get a certificate warning — just click Advanced and then Proceed. This is normal for a local self-signed certificate.

> Make sure `cert.pem` is in the same folder as `app.py`. If `cert.pem` is missing, the server will fall back to `http://localhost:5000` automatically.

All assets load from your local `assets/` folder — no internet connection needed once the page is open.

## How to use the tour

Once you're inside `LsbuTour.html`:

- **Look around** — click and drag on desktop, or just move your head in a headset
- **Switch scenes** — press **Q** on your keyboard to bring up the scene selection panel, then click the scene you want
- **Play / Pause** — the video panel has play and pause buttons controller for VR headsets
- **VR headset** — if you're on a Quest or similar, use the right controller B button to open the scene switcher

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**Black screen when loading the tour?**

This is usually just the 360° video buffering on first load. Try these in order:

1. Click anywhere on the page first — browsers block video autoplay until you interact
2. Wait a few seconds for the video to buffer
3. Hard refresh the page with **`Ctrl + Shift + R`**

**Video not loading at all?**

Make sure your `assets/video/` folder has all the mp4 files in it — they're large files so double check they copied across properly.
