# AR-VR-Group-6

## Project Overview

### What is this?

This is our Group 6 project for London South Bank University. We built a virtual reality tour of the LSBU campus using A-Frame, so that prospective and current students can explore the university without having to be there in person. You can use it in a normal browser on your laptop or phone, or put on a VR headset for the full experience.

We filmed five real locations on campus and turned them into 360° videos with voiceovers, captions, and on-screen labels that pop up as you look around.

## What's inside the tour

- **Student Centre** — the first floor, the bar area (The Venue), and the cafeteria upstairs
- **Cafeteria** — the seating booths, the student kitchen, and links to the art block and Faraday wing
- **Outside Student Centre** — the view outside including Tesco opposite, LSBU Hub to the left, and Borough Road building
- **LSBU Hub** — the Student Help Desk, the coffee shop, the library, study rooms, and the sports hall

- **Robot Special Feature** — a bonus video of a robot roaming through the Student Centre entrance

## ☁️ Cloudflare R2

The videos are too large to host on Vercel directly (some are over 500MB), so we uploaded them all to **Cloudflare R2** which serves them as a CDN. All the audio and images are on there too.

Everything in the `assets/` folder maps to our R2 bucket:

```
https://pub-5284e2be46f649b793c07aa2d104bb68.r2.dev/
```

This means the site loads fast no matter where it's hosted because the heavy files come straight from Cloudflare's global network rather than the hosting platform.
